<h1>4. Uncertainty</h1>

<p>One possible use for an animated bar chart is an animated uncertainty chart, which can be used to show how a set of estimates surrounded by a margin of error might also have looked given their statistical uncertainty. This chart starts with a given set of estimates. Clicking on the chart animates it with a generator that yields normal random variables for each data point with a standard deviation representing its margin of error.</p>

<p>This particular uncertainty chart is only suitable for certain types of data: each estimate must be independent, with known and normally distributed standard errors. You could model data that has a different error distribution using a different function for generating the randomised values.</p>

<h2>Use randomly generated data to illustrate statistical uncertainty</h2>
